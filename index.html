        <h1>Travel to Venice</h1>
        <p>Venice is a really nice city in Italy, and I really want to go there. Lets see why!</p>
        <h1>Sights</h1>
        <p>Venice is a beautiful and romantic city, floating on the sea, with canals flowing through it. <br>It is gorgeous, and the old buildings
        give a nice, warm vibe. <br>You can get a good view of the city on a gondola, and the bridges also give a nice view of the canal below.
        <br>There are also the pretty streets, and large marketplaces that look good. <br>And at night, the city glows very beatifully.
        <br>There's not much to say about the sights of Venice, but much more to see. <br>So, here is a nice picture, that gives you a good view.</p>

        <h1>Food</h1>
        <p>Venice is part of Italy, and if you are familiar with Italian food, you know what this place has in store for you. <br>Pizza, pasta,
        gelato, and plenty more! <br>I myself am Italian, and boy, I love this food! <br>There are plenty of restaraunts in Venice, and maybe you can 
        get a bite to eat at the marketplace, too. <br>Its hard to describe all the Italian food in venice, so before we get caught away, lets move on.</p>

        <h1>Shopping</h1>
        <p>Venice is a romantic city ,so you can expect some unique shopping. <br>You can get lots of charms and jewelry there,
        which some ladies may like. <br>Some of the streets are lined with shops, and in larger streets, expect to see more shops. <br>
        There are also marketplaces all over the city, where you can buy plenty of things.</p>

        <h1>Transportation</h1>
        <p>Venice's main way of travel is to ride in a gondola, and either by driven by somebody, or drive on your own. <br>
        You can feel the water slowly wocking your boat as you ride along in it, and get a good view of around the city. <br>
        If you don't want to take the canals, then you can use the extensive network of streets and bridges throughout the city, and the bridges have great views. <br>
        There isn't much to ay about the method of transport, but I love it, and love canoeing, so lets move on.</p>
