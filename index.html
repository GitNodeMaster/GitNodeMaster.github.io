        <h1>Travel to Venice</h1>
        <p>Venice is a really nice city in Italy, and I really want to go there. Lets see why!</p>
        <h1>Sights and Beauty</h1>
        <p>Venice is a beautiful and romantic city, floating on the sea, with canals flowing through it. It is gorgeous, and the old buildings
        give a nice, warm vibe. You can get a good view of the city on a gondola, and the bridges also give a nice view of the canal below.
        There are also the pretty streets, and large marketplaces that look good. And at night, the city glows very beatifully.
        There's not much to say about the sights of Venice, but much more to see. So, here is a nice picture, that gives you a good view.</p>
